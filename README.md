# 30-Days Python Challenge

Welcome to the 30-Days Python Challenge repository! This repository is created as a precursor to your learning of data science at the ArewaData Science Academy. The goal of this challenge is to help you build a strong foundation in Python programming before diving into data science concepts.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of Python scripts and notebooks for each day of the challenge. Each script/notebook is designed to cover a specific topic or concept, gradually progressing from basic to more advanced topics. The challenge is structured to be completed over 30 days, allowing me to dedicate consistent time to your learning journey.
